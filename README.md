# Spicity

The temperature-salinity data used in the manuscript entilted "Using the sigma-pi diagram to classify
water masses in the northern South China Sea in spring", which has been submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, are presented here.  These files contain the temperature(t)-salinity(s) and potential density(pdens)-potential spicity(spic) information of all the observation stations in the northern South China Sea in a spring cruise in 2011. The potential density and potential spicity are calculated based on UNESCO EOS_80 equation of state.
