# Spicity

The temperature-salinity data used in the manuscript entilted "Using the sigma-pi diagram to classify
water masses in the northern South China Sea in spring", which has been submitted to Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, are presented here.  These files contain the temperature(t)-salinity(s) and potential density(pdens)-potential spicity(spic) information of all the observation stations in the northern South China Sea in a spring cruise in 2011. The potential density and potential spicity are calculated based on UNESCO EOS_80 equation of state.

A matlab code namely sw_pspi.m is provided. This code is used to calculate the spicity, which is described in detailed in the paper entilted "New definition of potential spicity by the least square method" (Huang, R. X., Yu, L. S., & Zhou, S. Q. (2018).  Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, 123(10), 7351-736). If you use this code to do your owner research, please cite this paper. 
A python version of this code will be available soon.
